### Rules
____
*The rules are simple - roll the dice, collecting the same values until you collect all ten. 
To keep them on the next roll, simply click on them and they "freeze" it will unfreeze when you click again. 
There is also a __timer__ in the game, so you can find out how much time you have spent playing the game and
what your best result is. The rules are also written in the website.*
